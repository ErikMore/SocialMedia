    <p> I'm a computer science student. I have an interest in machine learning, more
        specifically neural networks. For my senior project I'd like to create a mobile app that helps users find their
        face shape using convolutional neural networks.</p>
    <p>Part of my projects includes working with replicating large language models using HuggingFace for medical datasets
        so that a user may ask for information.</p>

    <p>Additional machine learning projects include A3C models that learned how to drive a digital track without leaving
        the track with obstacles through the road. Other applications were training A3C to play atari games such as Pacman and KungFu.</p>

    <h2> You may be wondering what is A3C? Good Question!</h2>
    <p>A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic) is a reinforcement learning algorithm that is used to train deep neural
        networks to make decisions in an environment. It is designed to handle large and continuous action spaces,
        making it useful for a wide range of tasks.Biggest advantage over other models is the ability to achieve
        Asynchronous updates which allow for faster training.</p>
